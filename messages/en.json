After the train ride, I took the metro to the hotel room and took advantage of being in Paris to go for a short run to explore the city and visit the Eiffel Tower... The next day, we woke up at dawn — we were expected at 7 AM on the Epitech Paris campus. We were heading to the UTAC circuit in Montlhéry, where we visited the site and attended a presentation about a competition organized by UTAC. We also had the chance to do a few laps around the high-speed ring. We then returned to Epitech Paris and got to work on finishing the Robocar project. We pulled an all-nighter to work on it and were able to present the project the following morning. We headed back home in the afternoon."
